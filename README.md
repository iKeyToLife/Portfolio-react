## Description
This portfolio is a single-page application built with React to showcase my skills and projects as a web developer. The application highlights various sections, including About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, allowing potential employers to easily assess my qualifications. The design is mobile-first and utilizes modern React practices, ensuring an intuitive user experience.
